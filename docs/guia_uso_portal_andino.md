## First steps

** A clap, you're already opening your data! **

This guide will help you:

* Know the elements of the catalog and identify where they are seen in the portal.
* Customize the portal.
* Create datasets, resources, organizations and themes.

<p align = "center"> Let's Get Started! </p>

## Enter and exit your portal

In order to enter and exit your portal, ** your administrator must have created a username and password **. With that information, every time you want to enter the portal, ** you can do it from http: //*tu-url.com*/ingresar**.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-login.png "login")

** To exit **, just have to ** click the button in the upper right margin **.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-logout.png "logout")

** What if I forgot my password? **

At the moment, both the creation of the user and the password, as well as the recovery of the latter can only be done by those who have installed Andino.

## Elements of your portal

### Organizations

They are the organisms that open or maintain each dataset. ** It is very important that you create the organizations before you generate a dataset ** that is associated with it.

##### Where do I see it on the portal?

* As one of the Datasets view filters.

* As an added number, in the Main Page of your portal, in case you have chosen the view that shows the number of Organizations with data.

##### Best practices when creating Organizations with data

Keep in mind that ** whenever you delete an organization, all datasets (and also resources) will be permanently erased **.

##### How do I create them?

Go to ** Home> Create Organizations **.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-create-org.png "create-org")

In case you have chosen that your portal has a Organizations section with data, they will also be displayed there.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-sec-org.png "sec-org")
***
### Organizations section with data

** This section is optional **. It allows you to build a tree of hierarchies with the organizations that opened data on your portal. The organisms that are shown in this part of your portal are the same ones that you assign to the datasets and that you create before generating the latter.

##### Where do I see it on the portal?

In Home> ** Organizations with data **.

##### Best practices when creating the Organizations with data section

It is important to be clear on which organizations depend on others, so that the tree of hierarchies represents the correspondences correctly.

##### How do I create them?

Because the Organizations with data section is optional, you can choose to see it on your portal. To do this, ** go to Settings> Organizations with data ** and tick the enable.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-sec-org-02.png "sec-op-org")

***
### Topics

They are the categories in which you can classify all the datasets of your portal. There are two taxonomies of topics:

* ** Global Issues **, which already come with AbreAr, and you need to choose for each dataset. These topics are not seen in your portal, but you need to choose it so that the national portal data.gob.ar can republish the dataset according to this classification. For example: "Economy and finance".

* ** Specific topics **, which are optional, but we strongly recommend that you add all your datasets because they are the topics that your users will see. For example, if the global theme was "Economy and Finance", a specific topic might be "Purchasing".


##### Where do I see it on the portal?

* On the main page of your data catalog.

* Also as detail of each specific dataset.

! [Alt text] (assets / portal-andino-sec-themes.png "sec-themes")

##### Good Practices When Creating Specific Topics

* Try to create the specific themes conscientiously to be able to reuse them in the future.
* Do not create a specific theme for each dataset.
* Make sure that each specific topic is a smaller part within the Global Topics.

##### How do I create them?

** Go to Home> Create Theme **.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-sec-themes-03.png "sec-themes-03")

##### How do I assign them?

** Each time you generate a new dataset **, the form will prompt you to assign themes. Always remember to reuse the ones you have already created and do not repeat them.

! [Alt text] (assets / portal-andino-form-themes.png "form-themes")
***
### Datasets

We also call them "data sets". They are the main part of your portal or data catalog. Each dataset consists of one or more resources.

##### Where do I see them on the portal?

All datasets that you upload to the portal will be seen ** in the Datasets ** section. In addition, ** you will be able to highlight ** the ones that you create more important in the Main Page.

! [Alt text] (assets / portal-andino-sec-themes-02.png "sec-themes-2")

##### Good Practices When Creating Datasets

* ** Titles of datasets **: this is the first look users will have about their content. So try not to exceed 100 characters. Pay special attention to capital letters. Only their own nouns need them.

* ** Description of datasets **: is the detail that you tell the users. For that reason, it is important that you try to give a general explanation of the data you are going to find. Try not to exceed 500 characters.

##### How do I create them?

Log in to your account and go to ** Home> Create dataset **.

! [Alt text] (assets / portal-andino-create-dataset.png "create-dat")

** You can always edit the dataset ** you have created. To do this, go to your account> Home> Datasets> ** Edit dataset **.
***
### Means

Each dataset consists of at least one resource. That's why we say that resources are the smallest piece of information in the catalog and the real assets of data portal.

##### Where do I see them on the portal?

Home> Datasets> Click the specific resource.

##### Good Practices in Creating Resources
I followed the same writing criteria as the datasets.

* ** Titles **: try not to exceed 150 characters.

* ** Description of resources **: try not to exceed 200 characters.

##### How do I create them?

Log in to your account and go to Home> Create dataset. Once you complete the dataset, you can add resources.

! [Alt text] (assets / portal-andino-asig-resource.png "create-resource")

As with datasets, you can always edit the resources you have created. To do this, go to your account> Home> Datasets> Edit dataset> Edit features.
***
### Tags

They are the words that help users filter and find datasets. The wider and more uniform the list of labels, the greater its power of help.

##### Where do I see them on the portal?

In each specific dataset.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-dat-tags.png "dat-tags")

##### Good practices when creating labels

* Use capital letters only where appropriate.
* Identify keywords.
* Respect previous tags.
* Add synonyms and use natural language.
* Try to use a single word, always in the plural.
* If the label has more than one word, separate them by a space. For example: "affidavits".

Here are some useful questions when thinking about tags:

* Which is the topic?
* What aspects will be of interest to users?
* How else would the user find this information?
* What type of information is involved?
* What area does it provide?

##### How do I create them?

As with Themes, each time you generate a new dataset, the form will prompt you to assign a label. Always remember to reuse the ones you have already created and do not repeat them.

! [alt text] (assets / portal-andino-asig-tags.png "create-tags")

### Customize the portal

Making your website represent your organization is very easy. Please ** go to Home> Settings **. You will get to the section that allows you to change how the front cover of your data catalog and each particular section looks.
